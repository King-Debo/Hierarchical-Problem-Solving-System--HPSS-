# Hierarchical System

This is a project that aims to create a hierarchical system that can decompose and compose complex problems and solutions using multiple levels of abstraction. The project uses various components and techniques, such as hierarchical reinforcement learning, hierarchical Bayesian networks, hierarchical neural networks, and hierarchical planning, to learn and infer from both bottom-up and top-down information. The project also uses a large language model, such as GPT-3, to encode and decode the hierarchical representations, using natural language as the interface.

## Installation

To install the project, you need to have Python 3.7 or higher, and the following libraries and frameworks:

- torch
- transformers
- requests
- json

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install torch transformers requests json
